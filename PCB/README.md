# The PCB

This folder contains the files regarding the robot's Curcuit Board.  I designed the board in [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org/) and had it manufactured by [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/).  I bought the sockets and powerjack on [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/).  If you make changes to the board layout or design, you will have to change the [3D print files](../PrintFiles).
